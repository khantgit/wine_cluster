This GitHub Repository serves the collection of files that are needed for the web application using unsupervised machine learning for wine category clustering.

## Component	Explanation in Wine
Alcohol: The percentage of ethanol produced during fermentation determines the wine’s body and sensation of warmth.
Malic Acid: One of the primary acids found in grapes. High levels provide a sharp, tart taste (like green apples); often converted to softer lactic acid via malolactic fermentation.
Ash: The inorganic mineral content that would remain if the wine were incinerated. It primarily relates to the grape’s mineral uptake from the soil (part of "terroir").
Ash_Alcanity:	The alkalinity (basic strength) of the ash, which relates to the level of specific salts and buffering capacity of the wine.
Magnesium: A key mineral nutrient present in the ash content; important for yeast health during fermentation.
Total_Phenols: A broad category of chemical compounds that includes flavonoids and nonflavanoids. They are crucial for a wine’s color, taste, and aging potential.
Flavonoids: A subset of phenols found in grape skins and seeds. They contribute significantly to the color (anthocyanins) and structure (tannins) of red wine.
Nonflavanoid_Phenols:	Other phenolic compounds that contribute to the wine’s sensory profile and antioxidant properties.
Proanthocyanins:	A type of flavonoid (also called condensed tannins) known for providing astringency and bitterness, and essential for the aging potential of red wines.
Color_Intensity: A quantitative measure of the depth and darkness of the wine’s color, primarily derived from anthocyanins in the grape skins.
Hue: A measure of the specific shade of the wine's color (e.g., ruby red, purple, brick red), which can indicate age and grape variety.
OD280:	Stands for "Optical Density at 280 nm" (nanometers). This measure relates to the amount of phenolic compounds present that absorb UV light at this specific wavelength, linking to the wine's quality.
Proline: An amino acid found in grape must. High levels can indicate the quality of the grape must and are sometimes used as a quality control indicator.
